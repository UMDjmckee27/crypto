Final Project for INST 326 at the University of Maryland
Crypto Tracker that helps analyze current and past trends
Project uses CoinGecko API 
For this to work as a user you need to get your API key from coingecko.
Please see this https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/setting-up-your-api-key on how to get your own API key.

This code is ran from the command line and takes in the coin identification that you want to look at as an argument. For example, you would enter "main.py bitcoin ethereum solana"
